# Students app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live demo
https://students-app-fsc.herokuapp.com/


## How to run project

In the project directory run:

### `npm install`

### And then execute: 
`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Assumptions and comments 
1. The initial page will be the one with students table since the first thing I am assuming users will want to see is students and details.
2. The way to add a new student is via a modal because for this specific app a new full route/page it's not needed just to a small form.
